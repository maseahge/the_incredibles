# The Incredibles

####Our Approach:
Fortunately we were given topics to choose from, and as a group we narrowed down our top 3 very quickly.  We were all decided on our first pick, and were lucky enough to get it!

Once we had our project, we set up the neccessary interviews, and did 2 members per interview.  We changed up the paring for this, so that we each got to work separately with eachother.  We se aside 2 hours a day where we would work and code together, and then had our stand up meeting where we touched base too.

We divided the workload up by features, with each of us creating a branch for the feature we were working on.  Our Master of the Github - George - would handle all of the merges and conflicts, etc.

We had a very harmonious and synergistic group.  We collaborated and dove-tailed very well.
